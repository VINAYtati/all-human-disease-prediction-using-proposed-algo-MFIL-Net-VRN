# MFIL-Net + VRN: Multi-label Disease Prediction using Vital Signs

## üìå Short Description
This project proposes MFIL-Net + VRN, a novel framework for multi-label disease prediction using vital signs (HR, BP, Temp, SpO‚ÇÇ). By enhancing feature interactions and modeling resonance among signals, it achieves higher accuracy, reliability, and robustness than traditional ML models.

## üöÄ Overview
This project introduces a **robust and intelligent diagnostic framework** for predicting multiple human diseases using vital signs: **Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Body Temperature, and Oxygen Saturation (SpO‚ÇÇ)**.  

The proposed algorithm, **MFIL-Net + VRN (Medical Features Interaction Learning with Vital Resonance Network)**, integrates:
- **MFIL-Net** ‚Üí Learns complex feature interactions between vital parameters.  
- **VRN** ‚Üí Models resonance and dependencies between signals for more reliable predictions.  

The system supports **multi-label disease prediction**, allowing identification of multiple conditions simultaneously, reflecting real-world medical scenarios. It outperforms baseline machine learning models such as Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, KNN, and Decision Tree.
